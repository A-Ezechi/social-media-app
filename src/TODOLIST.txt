Input button Design
- On click of submit button, set the value into a state to hold it
- Map over length of the state to see if it's more than 1
- if > 1 : set state into new state array that holds feed
- if less than 1 print "Cannot be empty"
- 

We've moved the state over however, we have not moved over the functions that set the States. Thus, the components are not having their states set and returning 0 or null.
